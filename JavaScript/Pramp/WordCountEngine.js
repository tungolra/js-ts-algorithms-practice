Considerations: 
- case insensitive 
- remove punctuation
- return array of array container word + count of number of times word is found as string
- sorted by highest integer; then by order in sentence

Pseudocode: 
// split method to put words into array; also remove the punctuation
// initialize a hash
// loop through the var
  - set the key to the word and value as 1 
  - if word is already in hash, add 1 to value
  
// sort by count of occurrences ?

// {{word: "practice", freq: "3", firstOcc: 0}, ...}

/**
 * Pramp Solution
 * 
 * The first solution takes a more manual approach, iterating through the 
 * characters and building words without relying on regular expressions. 
 * It uses a Map and an additional array to organize the word counts. 
 * This approach may be more flexible if you need to perform additional 
 * operations on the word counts or modify the logic further.
 * 
Time Complexity: let N be the number of words in document and M the number 
of unique words in it (M â‰¤ N). Iterating over all words, cleaning them and
inserting them into a map takes O(N). The sorting step takes O(M) since
notice that in the second loop, every word gets visited only once. The 
total time complexity is therefore O(N + M), which is O(N).

Space Complexity: wordMap takes O(M) space and the array of strings array,
counterList, takes another O(M). So, in total, the space complexity is O(M).

  const wordMap = new Map();

    const charArray = [];

    for (let j = 0; j < word.length; j++) {
      const ch = word[j];
      if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') {
        charArray.push(ch);
      }
    }

    const cleanWord = charArray.join('');

      count = wordMap.get(cleanWord);
      count++;

      count = 1;
    }

    if (count > largestCount) {
